# Welcome to FreshBnb!

## FreshBnb is a mock property booking and hosting platform for caravans and buses. Inspired by the pandemic and airBnb. This is the client side of the final group project for one year intensive web development training at the Digital Career Institute. Project owners @katharinadobiosch @JanHapple @lopez-marc @giuseppefalcidia and myself @ediheid

### Statement

“Because of the ongoing pandemic, more people are travelling within their own countries or regions and camper sales have gone through the roof!
Socially distanced holidays are on the rise and of great importance to people from all demographics.
Since wild camping is not permitted in most European countries our vision was to build an easy to use, accessible and interactive booking platform for vans and campers including:

- Location scouting with integrated map and search capabilities
- Signup and login features so users can host and book private properties where vehicles can stay

..All with the intention to provide a safe and active community allowing users to legally ‘wild camp’! “
